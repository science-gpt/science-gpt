#### Overview

##### Proposed Registration Decision for Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide

Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), under the authority of the
_Pest Control Products Act and Regulations, is proposing full registration for the sale and use of_
Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide and Mettle 125 ME Fungicide, containing the technical grade
active ingredient tetraconazole, to control powdery mildew on grape, gooseberry, strawberry and
sugar beet; black rot on grape; and cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet.

An evaluation of available scientific information found that, under the approved conditions of
use, the product has value and does not present an unacceptable risk to human health or the
environment.

This Overview describes the key points of the evaluation, while the Science Evaluation provides
detailed technical information on the human health, environmental and value assessments of
tetraconazole and Mettle 125 ME Fungicide.

##### What Does Health Canada Consider When Making a Registration Decision?

The key objective of the Pest Control Products Act is to prevent unacceptable risks to people and
the environment from the use of pest control products. Health or environmental risk is
considered acceptable[1] if there is reasonable certainty that no harm to human health, future
generations or the environment will result from use or exposure to the product under its proposed
conditions of registration. The Act also requires that products have value[2] when used according
to the label directions. Conditions of registration may include special precautionary measures on
the product label to further reduce risk.

To reach its decisions, the PMRA applies modern, rigorous risk-assessment methods and
policies. These methods consider the unique characteristics of sensitive subpopulations in
humans (for example, children) as well as organisms in the environment (for example, those
most sensitive to environmental contaminants). These methods and policies also consider the
nature of the effects observed and the uncertainties when predicting the impact of pesticides. For
more information on how the PMRA regulates pesticides, the assessment process and
risk-reduction programs, please visit the Pesticides and Pest Management portion of Health
Canada’s website at healthcanada.gc.ca/pmra.

1 “Acceptable risks” as defined by subsection 2(2) of the Pest Control Products Act.

2 “Value” as defined by subsection 2(1) of the Pest Control Products Act: “the product’s actual or potential
contribution to pest management, taking into account its conditions or proposed conditions of registration,
and includes the product’s (a) efficacy; (b) effect on host organisms in connection with which it is intended
to be used; and (c) health, safety and environmental benefits and social and economic impact.”


-----

Before making a final registration decision on tetraconazole, the PMRA will consider all
comments received from the public in response to this consultation document.[3] The PMRA will
then publish a Registration Decision[4] on tetraconazole, which will include the decision, the
reasons for it, a summary of comments received on the proposed final registration decision and
the PMRA’s response to these comments.

For more details on the information presented in this Overview, please refer to the Science
Evaluation of this consultation document.

##### What Is Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide?

Tetraconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole fungicide belonging to the DMI (DeMethylation
Inhibitors) group. It inhibits the metabolic pathway that leads to fungal sterol production, which
makes fungal cell membranes nonfunctional. Tetraconazole is a systemic fungicide and is
absorbed quickly into the plant tissue. It has protectant and curative properties.

##### Health Considerations

**Can Approved Uses of Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide Affect Human Health?**

**Mettle 125 ME Fungicide containing Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide is unlikely to**
**affect your health when used according to label directions.**

Potential exposure to Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide may occur through the diet (food and
water), when handling and applying the end-use product Mettle 125 ME Fungicide or when
entering treated sites. When assessing health risks, two key factors are considered: the levels
where no health effects occur and the levels to which people may be exposed. The dose levels
used to assess risks are established to protect the most sensitive human population (for example,
children and nursing mothers). Only uses for which the exposure is well below levels that cause
no effects in animal testing are considered acceptable for registration.

Toxicology studies in laboratory animals describe potential health effects from varying levels of
exposure to a chemical and identify the dose where no effects are observed. The health effects
noted in animals occur at doses more than 100-times higher (and often much higher) than levels
to which humans are normally exposed when pesticide-containing products are used according to
label directions.

3 “Consultation statement” as required by subsection 28(2) of the Pest Control Products Act.

4 “Decision statement” as required by subsection 28(5) of the Pest Control Products Act.


-----

In laboratory animals, Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide was of slight acute toxicity via the oral
route and low acute toxicity via the dermal and inhalation routes of exposure; consequently, the
hazard signal words “CAUTION – POISON” are required on the label. It was minimally
irritating to the eyes, non-irritating to the skin, and did not cause an allergic skin reaction. The
acute toxicity of the end-use product Mettle 125 ME Fungicide was low via the oral, dermal and
inhalation routes of exposure. It was minimally irritating to the skin and eyes and did not cause
an allergic skin reaction. Consequently, no hazard signal words are required on the label.

There was no indication that Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide caused damage to the nervous
system or immune system. There was also no evidence to suggest that it damaged genetic
material or caused birth defects in animals. In addition, the young do not appear to be more
sensitive to Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide than the adult animal. Health effects in animals
given repeated doses of Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide included effects on the skin at points
of contact, bones, liver, kidneys, ovaries, adrenal glands and thyroid gland, as well as irritation of
the upper respiratory mucosal membranes. Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide also caused liver
tumours in the mouse. When Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide was given to pregnant or
nursing animals, fertility was slightly reduced and effects on the skeleton, liver, kidneys and
body weight of the developing fetus were observed. These effects, as well as slightly delayed
maturation in the juvenile animal, were observed at doses that were toxic to the mother.

The risk assessment protects against the effects of Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide by
ensuring that the level of human exposure is well below the lowest dose at which these effects
occurred in animal tests.

**Residues in Water and Food**

**Dietary risks from food and water are not of concern**

Aggregate dietary intake estimates (food plus water) revealed that the general population and
infants less than one year old, the subpopulation which would ingest the most tetraconazole
relative to body weight, are expected to be exposed to less than 48% of the acceptable daily
intake. Based on these estimates, the chronic dietary risk from tetraconazole is not of concern for
all population sub-groups. There were no cancer risks of concern for tetraconazole.

An aggregate (food and water) dietary intake estimate for the highest exposed population
(children 1 to 2 years old) used less than 2% of the acute reference dose, which is not a health
concern.

The Food and Drugs Act prohibits the sale of adulterated food, that is, food containing a
pesticide residue that exceeds the established maximum residue limit (MRL). Pesticide MRLs
are established for Food and Drugs Act purposes through the evaluation of scientific data under
the Pest Control Products Act. Food containing a pesticide residue that does not exceed the
established MRL does not pose an unacceptable health risk.


-----

Residue trials conducted throughout the United States using tetraconazole on sugar beets,
strawberries and grapes were acceptable. The MRLs for this active ingredient can be found in the
Science Evaluation of this consultation document

**Risks in Residential and Other Non-Occupational Environments**

**Occupational Risks From Handling Mettle 125 ME Fungicide**

**Occupational risks are not of concern when Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is used according to**
**the proposed label directions, which include protective measures.**

Farmers and custom applicators who mix, load or apply Mettle 125 ME Fungicide, as well as
field workers re-entering freshly treated fields, can come in direct contact with tetraconazole
residues on the skin. Therefore, the label specifies that anyone mixing/loading and applying
Mettle 125 ME Fungicide must wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, chemical resistant gloves,
socks and footwear during mixing and loading, application, clean-up and repair. The label also
requires that workers do not enter treated fields for 12 hours after application. Taking into
consideration these label statements, the number of applications and the expectation of the
exposure period for handlers and workers, the risk to these individuals are not a concern.

For bystanders, exposure is expected to be much less than that for workers and is considered
negligible. Therefore, health risks to bystanders are not of concern.

##### Environmental Considerations

**What Happens When Tetraconazole Is Introduced Into the Environment?**

Tetraconazole enters the environment when used as a foliar treatment on field crops. Once in the
terrestrial environment, tetraconazole binds to soil particles and has limited vertical movement in
most soils profiles. Tetraconazole is very persistent in soil; therefore, it is expected to carryover
from one growing season to the next and, over a long period of time, has potential for reaching
groundwater. In aquatic systems, tetraconazole is expected to move from the water column into
sediments where it will persist. Tetraconazole is rapidly metabolised and excreted in fish and is
therefore not expected to bioconcentrate. Tetraconazole is not expected to evaporate from the
soil or water surface; therefore, the atmospheric concentration of tetraconazole is expected to be
negligible. Tetraconazole is not expected to form any major transformation products in the
environment because the transformation products transform much more quickly than they are
formed.


-----

Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is to be applied by field boom and airblast sprayers. Non-target
terrestrial and aquatic habitats can potentially be exposed to tetraconazole as a result of spray
drift or runoff. When used according to the label directions, tetraconazole does not present a risk
to earthworms, bees, and aquatic organisms. Tetraconazole application can present a risk to
beneficial predatory arthropods, terrestrial plants, birds and small mammals; therefore, label
statements are required on the product label to inform users of the potential risks. No-spray
buffer zones are required between the treated area and downwind terrestrial habitats in order to
minimize the potential risk to terrestrial plants from exposure to off-field drift.

##### Value Considerations

**What Is the Value of Mettle 125 ME Fungicide?**

Mettle 125 ME Fungicide, containing Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide, has demonstrated
effectiveness in controlling powdery mildew on grape, gooseberry, strawberry and sugar beet;
black rot on grape; and cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet. Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is
formulated in micro emulsion (ME) and applied as a foliar treatment. Mettle 125 ME Fungicide
adds an alternative to the triazoles fungicides which will contribute to the limited disease
management options for these targeted diseases. In addition, registration of this product will give
Canadian growers access to an effective fungicide that is already available in the United States.

##### Measures to Minimize Risk

Labels of registered pesticide products include specific instructions for use. Directions include
risk-reduction measures to protect human and environmental health. These directions must be
followed by law.

The key risk-reduction measures being proposed on the label of Mettle 125 ME Fungicide to
address the potential risks identified in this assessment are as follows.

**Key Risk-Reduction Measures**

**Environment**

Tetraconazole can pose a risk to certain beneficial insects, terrestrial plants, birds and small
mammals. Precautionary label statements informing users of the risks to these organisms are
required on the product label. Spray drift of tetraconazole may pose a risk to non-target terrestrial
vascular plants. To mitigate potential exposure via spray drift, a no-spray buffer zone of one
metre is required to protect sensitive terrestrial habitats downwind. An advisory statement
recommending products containing tetraconazole not be applied in areas treated the previous
year is required due to tetraconazole’s persistence and concerns for carryover to the following
growing season.


-----

##### Next Steps

Before making a final registration decision on tetraconazole, the PMRA will consider all
comments received from the public in response to this consultation document. The PMRA will
accept written comments on this proposal up to 45 days from the date of publication of this
document. Please note that, to comply with Canada's international trade obligations, consultation
on the proposed MRLs will also be conducted internationally via a notification to the World
Trade Organization. Please forward all comments to Publications (contact information on the
cover page of this document). The PMRA will then publish a Registration Decision, which will
include its decision, the reasons for it, a summary of comments received on the proposed final
decision and the Agency’s response to these comments.

##### Other Information

When the PMRA makes its registration decision, it will publish a Registration Decision on
tetraconazole (based on the Science Evaluation of this consultation document). In addition, the
test data referenced in this consultation document will be available for public inspection, upon
application, in the PMRA’s Reading Room (located in Ottawa).

obtained in environmental media. Methods for residue analysis are summarized in Appendix I,
Table 1.

##### 3.0 Impact on Human and Animal Health

**3.1** **Toxicology Summary**

Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide (hereinafter referred to as tetraconazole) is a tetrafluorinated
systemic fungicide and is a member of the conazole (triazole) class of pesticides. It inhibits
sterol-demethylation in the fungal sterol production pathway.

A detailed review of the toxicological database for tetraconazole was conducted. The database is
complete, consisting of the full array of toxicity studies currently required for hazard assessment
purposes. The database also includes neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and various special
investigative studies including tumour mode of action (MOA) studies. In addition to the required
suite of genotoxicity studies, there were a number of additional such studies available to
characterize the mammalian metabolites tetraconazole-acid, tetraconazole-alcohol and
tetraconazole-difluoroacetic acid. The acute oral toxicity of tetraconazole-alcohol, tetraconazoledifluoroacetic acid and a mixture of the metabolites tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl-3OH and
tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl-5OH were also investigated. The studies were carried out in
accordance with currently accepted international testing protocols and Good Laboratory
Practices (GLP). The scientific quality of the data is high and the database is considered adequate
to define the majority of the toxic effects that may result from exposure to tetraconazole.

The metabolism and toxicokinetic were investigated using radiolabelled tetraconazole in single
and repeated dose oral studies in the rat. Absorption was rapid and dose dependent, with peak
concentrations in the blood occurring between 1 and 27 hours post-dose; the peak levels were
lower and occurred later in females compared to males. The extent of absorption was moderate
to high, as evidenced by the recovery of 52-76% of the administered dose (AD) in the urine.
Although not assessed directly, excretion via the bile into the feces was inferred, based on total
radiolabel recoveries of 12 to 36% AD in the feces after 72 hours, which were greater than the
recoveries of unchanged parent in the feces (< 6% AD). Excretion via exhalation was not
assessed. The absorbed radioactivity was widely distributed. Tissue-specific residue
concentrations were highest in the liver, kidney, ovaries and the adrenals. Radiolabel partitioned


-----

rapidly into the fat, but did not become concentrated in this tissue. Metabolism was extensive.
The primary transformation pathways were oxidation, reduction and conjugation reactions
mediated by glutathione. The major metabolite was 1,2,4-triazole, which was present in the urine
at 48 to 70% AD and in the feces at 6 to 10% AD. A sulfoxide conjugate of tetraconazole-acid
(P1) and an N-acetylcysteine conjugate of tetraconazole-alcohol (P4) were prevalent in the urine
and/or feces, with P1 and P4 predominating in females and males, respectively. Unconjugated
tetraconazole-acid was also prevalent in the urine of females. Minor metabolites in the urine
included a glucuronide conjugate of tetraconazole-alcohol (M3), M6, P2 and P3, as well as
tetraconazole-acid in males. Minor metabolites in the feces included tetraconazole-alcohol and
P5. Also, tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl-3OH (S5, < 4% AD) and tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl5OH (S6, < 2% AD) both occurred in the feces (free) and urine (conjugated), while
tetraconazole-difluoroacetic acid was detected only in the urine (<2% AD). Excretion was rapid;
the half-lives were 11 to 16 hours. Less than 6% AD was retained in the carcass and tissues after
72 hours, indicating that retention and negligible. There was no also evidence of
bioaccumulation with repeated doses. Increased urinary excretion with repeated exposures was
considered indicative of metabolic adaptation. Overall, there were only minor differences in the
metabolism and toxicokinetics of tetraconazole, regardless of the sex or dose level and whether
dosing was single and repeated.

In the rat, the acute toxicity of tetraconazole was slight via the oral route and low via the dermal
and inhalation routes of exposure. It was slightly irritating to the eyes and non-irritating to the
skin of the rabbit, and was not a skin sensitizer in guinea pigs. The acute toxicity of Mettle
125 ME Fungicide was low in the rat via the oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposure. It
was minimally irritating to the skin and eyes of the rabbit and was not a skin sensitizer in guinea
pigs.

The mouse, rat and dog exhibited similar sensitivities in the short-term dosing studies. Based on
the collective studies, conducted via the oral (mouse, rat and dog), dermal (rabbit) and inhalation
(rat) routes of exposure, the liver, kidneys, bones (rodents), endocrine organs (ovaries, pituitary
gland and adrenal glands) and the upper respiratory mucosa were identified as the primary target
organs of toxicity. The skin also exhibited contact irritation with repeated exposure. Effects on
the bones and the ovaries were more evident with chronic dosing in the rat. The thyroid gland
was affected over short and chronic periods in the rat, but this was likely secondary to
tetraconazole’s effects on metabolism in the liver. The testes in rodents were also affected, but
only at higher dose levels. Decreases in body weight and body weight gain also generally
occurred at higher dose levels.

The earliest signs of hepatotoxicity occurred as increased weight, centrilobular hepatocellular
hypertrophy and cytotoxicity (for example, hepatocyte necrosis). The latter effect was transient
in rodents; likely due to metabolic adaptation in the liver. Altered lipid metabolism also occurred
in the rat and dog following short-term dosing and in the mouse following chronic dosing.
Generally, the short-term effects noted in the rodent liver did not progress appreciably with
chronic dosing. At higher doses or with chronic exposure, additional effects in the rodent liver
included accentuated lobular markings, eosinophilic hepatocyte areas (foci), pale or dark
subcapsular foci, as well as bile duct and sinusoid changes. With chronic exposure to high doses
the mouse also exhibited masses with raised pale or dark subcapsular areas.


-----

Toxicity in the kidney was most evident in the dog, minimally evident in the rat and absent in the
mouse after short-term exposure. In the dog and rat, effects included increased kidney weight
and slightly increased blood ion levels. Additional effects in the dog included kidney
enlargement, cortical tubule hypertrophy and apoptotic bodies, and transient alterations in urine
chemistry. Durational effects in the rat were minimal (increased pyelitis, basophilic cortical
tubules and slight changes in urine chemistry). At low to mid dose levels, increased kidney
weight was the only chronic effect evident in the mouse. Additional kidney effects in the mouse
were evident only at dose levels that also caused increased mortality.

In short-term studies, effects on the bones were not evident in the mouse or the dog and only
minimally evident in the rat at moderately high doses. Chronic effects on the bones in the rat
included increased pale/whitened incisors as well as osseus hypertrophy and thickening of the
cranial bones. At higher dose levels, the incisors were overgrown and thickened and the brain
exhibited secondary dorsal depression and dilated ventricles due to the excess growth of the
cranial bones. Although comparable bone effects occurred in the mouse, they were evident only
at notably higher dose levels than in the rat. Based on evidence from two special mechanistic
toxicity studies, the effects on teeth and bones appear to be due to fluorosis caused by the
metabolic release of fluoride ions from tetraconazole.

Endocrine-related effects were observed in both rodent species, but were most evident in the rat.
Among such effects in the rat, decreased adrenal weight in males, altered thyroid function and
perturbed hormone levels in the blood (steroid, thyroid and pituitary) were the most sensitive
indicators of endocrine perturbation. Acute effects in the rat were limited to a non-adverse
prolongation of diestrus and altered blood levels of several steroid hormones. Following
short-term dosing, endocrine-related effects occurred in the rat, but not in the mouse. Adrenal
weight was decreased in the male rat. At higher doses in the rat, pituitary, testes, uterus and
ovary weights were also affected. There were only minimal durational effects on the adrenal and
pituitary glands in the rat. In contrast, with longer dosing in the rat the corpora lutea were either
less prominent or completely absent. In the rat, changes in the blood levels of ovarian and
adrenal cortex hormones (aldosterone, corticosterone, progesterone and testosterone) were
dose-concordant with alterations in the ovarian and adrenal weights. Additional long-term
endocrine-related changes in the rat included increased fluid distension in the uterus and
increased squamous metaplasia of the endometrial glands. All of these changes are consistent
with treatment-related effects on endocrine system function. In the mouse long-term study, there
were effects on the testes and the ovaries, but only at doses that were sufficiently high to also
cause increased mortality.


-----

There were no short-term systemic effects via the dermal route in the short-term dermal rabbit
study up to the highest dose tested of the formulated end-use product. In contrast, dermal contact
irritation occurred at the lowest dose tested. In the short-term inhalation study in the rat, effects
at the lowest dose tested were largely restricted to the upper respiratory mucosa. These effects
included increases in squamous cell metaplasia of the laryngeal mucosa, mononuclear cell
infiltration of the larynx, and goblet cell hypertrophy of the nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal duct
in both sexes. Systemic effects occurring at the lowest dose tested also included thyroid follicular
cell hypertrophy in males. At the highest dose tested, lung weights were also increased.

There was no evidence of sensitivity in either the two-generation rat reproductive toxicity study
or in the prenatal developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit. Maternal toxicity in the rat
developmental toxicity study occurred as decreased body weight, body weight gain and food
consumption as well as increased water intake, liver weight and relative kidney weights. At the
same dose level in the offspring, there were increased incidences of small fetuses and
developmental variations (supernumerary ribs, hydroureter and hydronephrosis). Increased
incidences of domed cranium and absent tail also occurred in offspring at this dose level in the
rat range-finding developmental toxicity study, but these effects were not evident in the main
study involving a larger number of animals. Developmental toxicity was not evident in the
rabbit. Maternal effects in the rabbit were limited to decreased body weight and body weight
gain at the highest dose tested. In the two-generation rat reproductive toxicity study, parental
toxicity at the mid dose level involved increased mortality, decreased body weight and body
weight gain in females, and decreased adrenal weight in males. Effects at the high dose level
were consistent with other studies in the database, including increased ovary weight.
Reproductive toxicity was not evident in males, but in females at the mid dose, there were
increases in the duration of gestation, total litter loss and dystocia. In the offspring, relative liver
weight was increased at the mid dose level. Effects in pups at the high dose included increased
absolute liver weights, slight decreases in the number of litters and live pups, slight delays in
developmental landmarks (for example, sexual maturation), and decreases in litter and pup body
weights.

Tetraconazole was tested for potential genotoxic activity in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays.
Based on the uniformly negative results of these studies, tetraconazole was not considered
genotoxic. Consistent with this, there were no treatment-related oncogenic changes in the rat and
the oncogenic changes in the mouse were considered threshold-dependent, rather than a
consequence of direct genotoxicity. In the mouse, there were increased incidences of
hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in males and females at 118 and 140 mg/kg bw/day and
higher, respectively. The results from special mechanistic studies in rodents were sufficiently
robust to support mitogenesis as the probable causative mode of action for the liver tumours in
the mouse. The tumourigenic precursor events of tetraconazole’s mitogenic mode of action in the
mouse are similar to those of phenobarbital. However, the available information for both of these
chemicals has not been sufficiently developed to establish that their modes of action should be
considered the same (Nesnow et al. 2009). Given this, the occurrence of liver tumours in the
mouse is considered relevant to humans.


-----

Nervous system function was transiently altered in the rat following acute exposure to high doses
of tetraconazole. There was decreased motor activity in both sexes on the day of exposure and
transient clinical signs in females for one to several days. With repeated dosing in the rat, there
was reduced overall activity in males at the highest dose tested. At the same dose level, female
activity was increased, but this occurred primarily during the first week of exposure. Fluoride
ions, released from tetraconazole during its metabolism, have the potential to influence nervous
system function. However, there was no evidence of either central or peripheral nervous system
damage in these neurotoxicity studies and no indication in the broader toxicity database that the
nervous system was a specific target. Overall, tetraconazole was not considered selectively
neurotoxic.

In an immunotoxicity study in the rat, there were slight decreases in the number of antibodyforming cells at the mid and high dose, but there was a high degree of variability in this assay
and the complementary natural killer cell assay was negative. Given the uncertainty regarding
the positive result, the lack of concordance between these two assays and the absence of any
evident effect on the immune system in the broader toxicology database, tetraconazole was not
considered selectively immunotoxic.

The toxicities of five minor metabolites were assessed. In the rat, tetraconazole-alcohol,
tetraconazole-difluoroacetic acid and a mixture of tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl-3OH and
tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl-5OH were of low acute oral toxicity. Similarly, tetraconazole-acid,
tetraconazole-alcohol and tetraconazole-difluoroacetic acid were negative in a battery of in vitro
and/or in vivo genotoxicity assays. In an in vitro mammalian clastogenicity assay, tetraconazoleacid caused chromosomal aberrations in some of the individual tests at doses that were largely
cytotoxic. Although this was classified as a positive result, the effects occurred at concentrations
that are unlikely to occur in vivo. Overall, the metabolites investigated were not considered to
have in vivo genotoxic potential.

Results of the toxicology studies conducted on laboratory animals with tetraconazole and its
associated end-use products are summarized in Appendix I, Tables 2 and 3. The toxicology
endpoints for use in the human health risk assessment are summarized in Appendix I, Table 4.

**Incident Reports (Health)**
Since April 26, 2007, registrants have been required by law to report incidents, including adverse
effects to health and the environment, to the PMRA within a set time frame. Information on the
reporting of incidents can be found on the Pesticides and Pest Management portion of Health
Canada’s website. Tetraconazole and Mettle 125 ME Fungicide have been registered for
pesticidal use in the United States since 2005. However, as of July 12, 2012, there have been no
health-related incident reports involving the use of tetraconazole in the United States.

**3.1.1 Pest Control Products Act Hazard Characterization**

For assessing risks from potential residues in food or from products used in or around homes or
schools, the Pest Control Products Act requires the application of an additional 10-fold factor to
threshold effects to take into account completeness of the data with respect to the exposure of,
and toxicity to, infants and children, and potential prenatal and postnatal toxicity. A different
factor may be determined to be appropriate on the basis of reliable scientific data.

With respect to the completeness of the toxicity database as it pertains to the toxicity to infants
and children, extensive data were available for tetraconazole. The database contains the full
complement of required studies including developmental toxicity studies in the rat and the rabbit,
and a reproductive toxicity study in the rat. A developmental neurotoxicity study was not
warranted, based on an overall assessment of the mammalian toxicology database.

With respect to potential prenatal and postnatal toxicity, there was no indication of increased
susceptibility of fetuses or offspring compared to parental animals in the reproductive and
prenatal developmental toxicity studies. Developmental toxicity (supernumerary ribs,
hydroureter and hydronephrosis) was observed in the rat developmental toxicity study; however,
these effects occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity characterized by decreased body
weight, body weight gain and food consumption as well as increased water intake, liver weight
and relative kidney weights. No developmental toxicity was observed in the rabbit
developmental toxicity study. In the two-generation rat reproductive toxicity study, effects in the
offspring included slight delays in developmental landmarks, decreased litter and pup body
weights, increased liver weight and decreased litter and live pups numbers. These endpoints in
the young occurred in the presence of serious maternal toxicity (increased mortality, decreased
body weight and body weight gain, increases in the duration of gestation, total litter loss and
dystocia).

Overall, endpoints in the young were well-characterized and there was no increase in
susceptibility. On the basis of this information, the Pest Control Products Act factor was reduced
to 1-fold.

**3.2** **Acute Reference Dose (ARfD)**

**General Population**
To estimate acute dietary risk (1 day), the acute neurotoxicity study in the rat with a no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 50 mg/kg bw was selected for risk assessment. At the lowest
observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 200 mg/kg bw, decreased motor activity in both sexes
and transient clinical signs in females were observed. These effects were the result of a single
exposure and are therefore relevant to an acute risk assessment. Standard uncertainty factors of
10-fold for interspecies extrapolation and 10-fold for intraspecies variability have been applied.
As discussed in the Pest Control Products Act Hazard Characterization section, the Pest Control
_Products Act factor was reduced to 1-fold. The composite assessment factor (CAF) is 100._


-----

The ARfD is calculated according to the following formula:

ARfD = NOAEL = 50 mg/kg bw = 0.5 mg/kg bw of tetraconazole
CAF 100

**3.3** **Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)**

To estimate repeated dietary exposure risk, the 2-year chronic dietary study in the rat with a
NOAEL of 0.4 mg/kg bw/day was selected for risk assessment. At the LOAEL of 3.4 mg/kg
bw/day, decreased body weight and altered liver function (altered fat distribution, accentuated
lobular markings, hepatocyte necrosis) were observed along with pathological effects in the
bones (pale/broken incisors, osseus hypertrophy and thickening of the cranial bones) in males
and effects on reproductive organs in females (endometrial glands, uterus and ovary). This study
provides the lowest NOAEL in the database and incorporates findings from the target organs and
probable endocrine system effects. Standard uncertainty factors of 10-fold for interspecies
extrapolation and 10-fold for intraspecies variability have been applied. As discussed in the Pest
_Control Products Act Hazard Characterization section, the Pest Control Products Act factor was_
reduced to 1-fold. The composite assessment factor (CAF) is 100.

The ADI is calculated according to the following formula:

ADI = NOAEL = 0.4 mg/kg bw/day = 0.004 mg/kg bw/day of tetraconazole

CAF 100

The ADI provides a margin of approximately 3,000 to the NOAEL for liver tumours in the
mouse.

**Cancer Assessment**
There was adequate evidence to support a threshold-based mode of action for the liver tumours
in the mouse. The dietary reference dose (i.e. the ADI) and the selected margin of exposures
(MOEs) for occupational and bystander exposure provide a sufficient margin to this tumour type.

**3.4** **Occupational and Residential Risk Assessment**

**3.4.1 Toxicological Endpoints**

**Short- and Intermediate-term Dermal**
Due to dosing constraints, and because the formulated product was used, the short-term dermal
toxicity study in the rabbit was inappropriate for risk assessment, thus necessitating the use of an
oral study for risk assessment. For short- and intermediate-term occupational dermal risk
assessment, a NOAEL of 0.7 mg/kg bw/day from the reproductive toxicity study in the rat was
selected. At the LOAEL of 4.9 mg/kg bw/day, decreased adrenal weights were observed in adult
males and increased mortality along with decreased body weights and body weight gains were
observed in adult females. This study was selected as it encompassed the relevant duration of
exposure and assessed the most sensitive target organ of toxicity.


-----

The target MOE is 100. Ten-fold factors were applied each for interspecies extrapolation and
intraspecies variability. This MOE is considered to be protective of all individuals including
nursing infants and the unborn children of exposed female workers.

**Short- and Intermediate-term Inhalation**
For short- and intermediate-term occupational inhalation risk assessment, a LOAEL of
14.3 mg/kg bw/day (0.055 mg/L) from the 28-day inhalation toxicity study in the rat was
selected. At this dose, there were increases in squamous cell metaplasia of the laryngeal mucosa,
mononuclear cell infiltration of the larynx, and goblet cell hypertrophy in the nasal cavity and
nasopharyngeal duct in both sexes, along with thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in males. This
study was selected as it encompasses the relevant route of exposure and is of an appropriate
duration. The target MOE is 300. Ten-fold factors were applied each for interspecies
extrapolation and intraspecies variability. An additional 3-fold uncertainty factor was applied for
the lack of a NOAEL in the 28-day inhalation toxicity study. This MOE is considered to be
protective of all individuals including nursing infants and the unborn children of exposed female
workers.

**Acute Aggregate**
Acute aggregate exposure to tetraconazole may be comprised of food, drinking water and oral
and dermal exposure from harvesting activity at pick-your-own farm operations. Toxicological
endpoints and assessment factors chosen for the oral and dermal routes are the same as those for
the acute reference dose (see section entitled Acute Reference Dose). Although the endpoints
come from an oral toxicity study it was considered unlikely that the effects observed at the
LOAEL would occur at lower dose levels when exposure occurs via the dermal route. The acute
neurotoxicity study in the rat was selected instead of the 21-day dermal toxicity study in the
rabbit because neurotoxicity effects were not assessed in the rabbit dermal toxicity study, and the
study was not considered appropriate for risk assessment, as discussed above.

Occupational exposure to tetraconazole is characterized as short-to-intermediate in duration and
is predominantly by the dermal and inhalation routes.

A short-to-intermediate term dermal endpoint of 0.7 mg/kg bw/day was selected from a rat
reproductive toxicity study. The target MOE for dermal exposure to tetraconazole is 100.

A short-to-intermediate term inhalation endpoint of 14.3 mg/kg bw/day was selected from a
28-day rat inhalation toxicity study. The target MOE for inhalation exposure to tetraconazole
is 300.


-----

**3.4.1.1 Dermal Absorption**

In support of the tetraconazole application, the applicant submitted an in vivo dermal absorption
study in rats and an in vitro dermal absorption study in rat and human skin. The submitted
dermal penetration studies for tetraconazole were of good quality and the ‘triple pack’ approach
was considered for setting a dermal absorption value. However, the submitted studies did not
qualify for the draft NAFTA triple-pack approach, as they utilized different exposure durations
(8 hours for the in vivo study and 24 or 48 hours for the in vitro study). Therefore, the dermal
absorption value of 30%, based on the results from the low dose group (0.4 µg/cm[2]) in the
in vivo rat study after 96 hours of collection, is considered appropriate for use in risk assessment
of tetraconazole.

**3.4.2 Occupational Exposure and Risk**

**3.4.2.1 Mixer/loader/applicator (M/L/A) Exposure and Risk Assessment**

Individuals have potential for exposure to Mettle 125 ME Fungicide during mixing, loading and
application. As chemical specific data for assessing human exposures were not submitted, dermal
and inhalation exposure estimates for workers were estimated using the Pesticide Handlers
Exposure Database (PHED), version 1.1. PHED is a compilation of generic mixer/loader and
applicator passive dosimetry data which facilitates the generation of scenario-specific exposure
estimates.

Exposure to workers mixing, loading and applying Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is expected to be
short-to-intermediate term in duration and to occur primarily by the dermal and inhalation routes.
Exposure estimates were derived for mixer/loaders/applicators applying Mettle 125 ME
Fungicide to strawberries, sugar beets and gooseberries using groundboom application
equipment and to grapes and gooseberries using airblast application equipment. The exposure
estimates were based on mixers/loaders/applicators wearing the proposed personal protective
equipment (PPE) – a single layer and chemical-resistant gloves.

Dermal exposure was estimated by coupling the unit exposure values with the amount of product
handled per day and the dermal absorption value of 30%. Inhalation exposure was estimated by
coupling the unit exposure values with the amount of product handled per day with 100%
inhalation absorption. Exposure was normalized to mg/kg bw/day by using 70 kg adult body
weight.

Dermal exposure estimates were compared to the NOAEL of 0.7 mg/kg bw/day to obtain the
MOE; the target MOE is 100. Inhalation exposure estimates were compared to the NOAEL of
14.3 mg/kg bw/day to obtain the MOE; the target MOE is 300.

Inhalation (farmers): based on NOAEL = 14.3 mg/kg bw/day, target MOE = 300
Shaded values represent margins of exposure that did not reach the target of 100.

The calculated MOE for dermal and inhalation exposure to chemical handlers mixing/loading
and applying tetraconazole to strawberries, grapes and gooseberries exceeded the target MOE of
100 for dermal exposure and 300 for inhalation exposure. However, the calculated dermal MOE
for custom applicators mixing/loading and applying tetraconazole to sugar beets did not reach
the target MOE of 100. The calculated dermal MOE for sugar beets was based on a default area
treated per day (ATPD) for custom applicators of 360 ha.

In order to mitigate the potential risk, additional sources of information were consulted to
determine a more realistic area treated per day value for sugar beets. Statistics Canada Census of
Agriculture data from 2006 indicates that the average size of a sugar beet farm at the 95[th]
percentile is 186 ha. The Statistics on Pesticide Use Database (SPUD) stated that the area treated
per day for a sugar beet farm is 100 ha. Furthermore, use description information provided by the
registrant indicated that the expected area treated per day for a sugar beet farm is 32 ha.

Therefore taking into account all sources or information regarding the expected ATPD for sugar
beets and the likelihood that an ATPD of 186 ha/day is an overestimate, while an ATPD of 32 ha
is likely an underestimate, the actual ATPD is expected to be closer to the value of 100 ha from
the SPUD database. Since acceptable MOEs were calculated for dermal and inhalation exposure
when using an area treated per day of 100 ha, the potential exposure to custom applicators
treating sugar beet fields is not expected to result in unacceptable risk.

**3.4.2.2 Exposure and Risk Assessment for Workers Entering Treated Areas**

There is potential for exposure to workers re-entering areas treated with Mettle 125 ME
Fungicide performing activities such as hand harvesting, thinning, hand pruning, training, tying,
irrigation, scouting, cane turning and girdling, leaf pulling and hand weeding. Exposure is
expected to be of short- to intermediate-term in duration and to occur primarily by the dermal
route.

Dermal exposure to workers entering treated areas is estimated by coupling dislodgeable foliar
residue values with activity-specific transfer coefficients. Activity transfer coefficients are based
on data generated by the Agricultural Re-entry Task Force (ARTF). Chemical-specific
dislodgeable foliar residue data were not submitted. As such, a default dislodgeable foliar residue
value of 20% of the application rate was used with a 10% daily dissipation rate in the exposure
assessment.

Dermal exposure estimates were compared to the NOAEL of 0.7 mg/kg bw/day to obtain the
MOE; the target MOE is 100.

The calculated margins of exposure for the postapplication re-entry activities with the highest
transfer coefficients reached the target MOE of 100 on day 0 after the last application for
strawberries and gooseberries. However, for sugar beets and grapes, the target MOE was not
reached on day 0 after the last application.

Therefore, in order to mitigate the potential risk to postapplication re-entry workers, restricted
entry intervals are required for certain activities for sugar beets and grapes. Since the timing of
application is during periods that are favourable for disease development, it is possible that
applications may occur throughout the growing season. Therefore, it is assumed that
postapplication re-entry activities of concern may occur at any time following application and
restricted entry intervals are required. For sugar beets, a restricted entry interval of 3 days is
required for irrigation. For grapes, a restricted entry interval of 23 days is required for cane
turning and girdling in table grapes and a restricted entry interval of 15 days is required for hand
harvesting, training, thinning, hand pruning, tying and leaf pulling.

Since the proposed preharvest interval (PHI) for grapes is 14 days and a restricted entry interval
of 15 days is required for hand harvesting in order to reach an acceptable MOE, a label
amendment will be required to change the PHI to 15 days.

**3.4.3 Residential Exposure and Risk Assessment**

There are no residential uses for Mettle 125 ME Fungicide. Therefore, a residential handler
assessment was not required.

**3.4.3.1 Bystander Exposure and Risk**

Bystander exposure should be negligible since the potential for drift is expected to be minimal.

**Pick-Your-Own Scenario**
There is potential exposure to bystanders in pick-your-own scenarios for strawberries. Adults,
children and youth harvesting at pick-your-own operations have the potential for acute exposure
to tetraconazole residues as this activity is only expected to occur once per year. Acute dermal
exposure from harvesting at pick-your-own facilities may also co-occur with acute dietary
exposure.

For the pick-your-own risk assessment, a NOAEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day from an acute
neurotoxicity study in rats was deemed the appropriate endpoint for the dermal and dietary
exposure. Although the endpoint comes from an oral study, it was considered to cover both oral
and dermal exposure. Therefore, since the toxicological effects are the same for both routes of
exposure, the daily dose from both routes of exposure should be combined in an aggregate risk
assessment.

Exposure estimates were generated following the guidance in the PMRA Draft Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Pick-Your-Own Assessments. Dermal exposure to bystanders
re-entering treated strawberry fields is calculated by combining crop-specific DFR with activityspecific TCs.

**Aggregate Exposure and Risk Assessment**
To assess the potential dietary exposure to tetraconazole from strawberries in PYO operations, an
acute deterministic dietary exposure assessment was conducted using DEEM-FCID[TM] (Version
2.14). The proposed MRL of 0.25 ppm for Crop Subgroup 13-07G, which includes strawberries,
was used as the input value. The assessment was conducted for children aged 1-9 years, youth
aged 10-18 years, and adults over the age of 19. The appropriate values to aggregate with dermal
exposure are the exposure estimates at the 95[th] percentile. For the aggregate exposure
assessment, dermal and acute dietary exposure values are combined and compared to the
endpoint of concern.

**3.5** **Food Residues Exposure Assessment**

The residue definition for risk assessment and enforcement in plant products and animal
commodities is tetraconazole. The data gathering/enforcement analytical method is valid for the
quantification of tetraconazole residues in crop matrices and livestock matrices. The residues of
tetraconazole are stable when stored in a freezer at -20°C for 69 days in grape juice, 91 days in
raisins, 36 months in wheat grain and straw, 38 months in apples and grapes, and 40 months in
sugar beet roots. Tetraconazole residues concentrated in the processed commodity sugar beet
molasses (2.8×), but did not concentrate in the processed commodities sugar beet refined sugar,
grape juice or raisins. An adequate feeding study was carried out to assess the anticipated
residues in livestock matrices resulting from the current uses. Supervised residue trials conducted
throughout the United States using end-use products containing tetraconazole at exaggerated
rates in or on sugar beets, and at the proposed rates in or on strawberries and grapes are sufficient
to support the proposed maximum residue limits.

**3.5.1 Dietary Risk Assessment**

Acute and chronic dietary risk assessments were conducted using the Dietary Exposure
Evaluation Model (DEEM–FCID™, Version 2.14), which uses updated food consumption data
from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Continuing Surveys of Food Intakes by
Individuals, 1994–1996 and 1998.

**Triazole Metabolites**
Dietary exposure to 1,2,4-triazole (T), triazolyl-1-alanine (TA) and triazolyl-1-acetic acid (TAA)
may occur from the use of tetraconazole on food commodities. Residues of TA in plant
commodities are regulated in Canada not to exceed 2.0 ppm. These metabolites are common to
all triazole fungicides, including tetraconazole. The cumulative risks from T, TA, and TAA will
be addressed in a separate document.

**3.5.1.1 Chronic Dietary Exposure Results and Characterization**

The following criteria were applied to the refined chronic analysis: 100% crop treated, default
and experimental processing factors, residues of tetraconazole in crops at supervised trial median
residue (STMdRs) values, and residues of tetraconazole in animal commodities at anticipated
residue values. The refined chronic dietary exposure from all supported tetraconazole food uses
(alone) for the total population, including infants and children, and all representative population
subgroups are 11% of the ADI. Aggregate exposure from food and water is considered
acceptable. The PMRA estimates that chronic dietary exposure to tetraconazole from food and
water is 18.0% (0.000722 mg/kg bw/day) of the ADI for the total population. The highest
exposure and risk estimate is for all infants (< 1 year) at 47.4% (0.001894 mg/kg bw/day) of
the ADI.


-----

**3.5.1.2 Acute Dietary Exposure Results and Characterization**

The following criteria were applied to the basic acute analysis: 100% crop treated, default
processing factors, and residues of tetraconazole in/on crops and animal commodities at MRL
levels. The basic acute dietary exposure from all supported tetraconazole food uses was
estimated to be 0.6% of the ARfD for the general population (95[th] percentile, deterministic).
Aggregate exposure from food and water is considered acceptable and below PMRA’s level of
concern. Specifically, an acute dietary exposure of 0.4-1.8% of the ARfD (95[th] percentile,
deterministic) was obtained for all population subgroups, with children 1-2 years old as the
highest exposed population subgroup.

**3.5.2 Aggregate Exposure and Risk**

The aggregate risk for tetraconazole consists of exposure from food and drinking water sources
only; there are no residential uses. Given that strawberries can be treated with tetraconazole,
there is potential for exposure to tetraconazole during pick-your-own harvesting activities
(Refer to Section 3.4.3.1 - Bystander Exposure and Risk).

The nature of the residues in animal and plant matrices, analytical methodology, field trial data,
and the acute and chronic dietary risk estimates are summarized in Appendix I, Tables 1, 5 and 6.

##### 4.0 Impact on the Environment

**4.1** **Fate and Behaviour in the Environment**

Based on its physical-chemical properties, tetraconazole is very soluble in water and is not likely
to volatilize from moist soil or water surfaces. It has low volatility at environmentally relevant
temperatures and is not expected to be present in the air at significant levels.

Tetraconazole is persistent in the terrestrial environment and is not expected to form any major
transformations products. However, prolonged exposure of tetraconazole residues on thin soil
layers to sunlight can result in the formation of several transformation products:
M14360-alcohol, triazolyl acetic acid, M14360-acid, triazole and M14360-difluoroacetic acid.
Both triazolyl acetic acid and M14360-alcohol are non-persistent in the terrestrial environment.
M14360-acid is the most persistent transformation product but is less persistent than
tetraconazole.

According to the results of laboratory soil column leaching studies and adsorption and desorption
studies, tetraconazole has low mobility potential in most soils. Tetraconazole’s high soil
adsorption capacity implies limited vertical movement through the soil profile and a low
potential for groundwater contamination. However, its high water solubility and persistence in
the environment may allow it to reach groundwater under some environmental conditions after
repetitive applications over long periods of time. Transformation products of tetraconazole are
more mobile than tetraconazole. However, they are not expected to be found in significant
quantities in ground water because tetraconazole is considerably more persistent than these
transformation products, which are expected to transform at a faster rate than they are formed.
Terrestrial field dissipation studies in the United States and Germany confirm that tetraconazole
is persistent with limited mobility. The results of these field dissipation studies also indicate
tetraconazole has the potential to accumulate in soil and carryover to the following growing
season.

Tetraconazole can enter the aquatic environment through spray drift, overland runoff or through
the movement of tetraconazole bound to soil particles. Upon entering the aquatic environment,
tetraconazole is expected to partition from the water column into sediments due to its high soil
adsorption ability. As it is stable to hydrolysis, phototransformation and biotransformation in
aquatic systems, tetraconazole is persistent in the aquatic environment. No major transformation
products were detected in laboratory aquatic studies.

Environmental fate data for tetraconazole and its transformation products are summarized in
Appendix I, Table 7.


-----

**4.2** **Environmental Risk Characterization**

The environmental risk assessment integrates the environmental exposure and ecotoxicology
information to estimate the potential for adverse effects on non-target species. This integration is
achieved by comparing exposure concentrations with concentrations at which adverse effects
occur. Estimated environmental exposure concentrations (EECs) are concentrations of pesticide
in various environmental media, such as food, water, soil and air. The EECs are estimated using
standard models which take into consideration the application rate(s), chemical properties and
environmental fate properties, including the dissipation of the pesticide between applications.
Ecotoxicology information includes acute and chronic toxicity data for various organisms or
groups of organisms from both terrestrial and aquatic habitats including invertebrates,
vertebrates, and plants. Toxicity endpoints used in risk assessments may be adjusted to account
for potential differences in species sensitivity as well as varying protection goals (i.e. protection
at the community, population, or individual level).

Initially, a screening level risk assessment is performed to identify pesticides and/or specific uses
that do not pose a risk to non-target organisms, and to identify those groups of organisms for
which there may be a potential risk. The screening level risk assessment uses simple methods,
conservative exposure scenarios (for example, direct application at a maximum cumulative
application rate) and sensitive toxicity endpoints. A risk quotient (RQ) is calculated by dividing
the exposure estimate by an appropriate toxicity value (RQ = exposure/toxicity), and the risk
quotient is then compared to the level of concern (LOC). If the screening level risk quotient is
below the level of concern, the risk is considered negligible and no further risk characterization
is necessary. If the screening level risk quotient is equal to or greater than the level of concern,
then a refined risk assessment is performed to further characterize the risk. A refined assessment
takes into consideration more realistic exposure scenarios (such as drift to non-target habitats)
and might consider different toxicity endpoints. Refinements may include further
characterization of risk based on exposure modelling, monitoring data, results from field or
mesocosm studies, and probabilistic risk assessment methods. Refinements to the risk
assessment may continue until the risk is adequately characterized or no further refinements are
possible.

**4.2.1 Risks to Terrestrial Organisms**

A risk assessment of tetraconazole, its end-use product Mettle 125 ME Fungicide and three
transformation products: M14360-alcohol, M14360-triazolyl acetic acid and M14360-acid was
undertaken for terrestrial organisms based on available toxicity data to earthworms (acute contact
and reproduction), bees (acute contact and oral), three species of predatory arthropods (contact),
one parasitic arthropod (contact), birds (acute oral, dietary and reproduction), mammals (acute
oral and reproduction), and ten crop species of terrestrial plants (seedling emergence and
vegetative vigours). For beneficial insects, toxicity studies for two tetraconazole formulations
were reviewed: Tetraconazole 125 g/L ME (representative of Mettle 125 ME Fungicide) and
Tetraconazole 40 g/L ME (a similar microemulsion formulation for the European market). A
summary of the terrestrial toxicity data for tetraconazole is presented in Appendix I, Table 8. For
the assessment of risk, toxicity endpoints chosen from the most sensitive species were used as


-----

surrogates for the wide range of species that can be potentially exposed following treatment with
tetraconazole.

**Earthworms and soil-dwelling arthropods**
Acute and chronic exposure of earthworms to tetraconazole can cause mortality and decreased
body weights. The end-use product, Tetraconazole 125 g/L ME and the transformation products,
M14360-alcohol, M14360-triazolyl acetic acid and M14360-acid, are less toxic than
tetraconazole.

The EEC is calculated based on a direct application of tetraconazole to bare soil at the maximum
cumulative application rate. The EEC values for M14360-alcohol, M14360-triazolyl acetic acid
and M14360-acid were determined according to a worst-case scenario assuming 100%
conversion of tetraconazole and were corrected for the molecular weight ratio of the
transformation products to tetraconazole. The risk to earthworms resulting from acute and
chronic exposure to tetraconazole does not exceed the LOC; therefore, there is also no concern
from acute exposure to the transformation products and the end-use product. (Appendix I,
Table 9).

**Bee (pollinators) and beneficial arthropods**
Acute oral and contact exposure of adult honey bees to high residues of tetraconazole and
Tetraconazole 125 g/L ME can result in mortality and behavioural abnormalities, such as
discoordination, apathy, intensive cleaning and nervous behaviour. Tetraconazole is classified as
relatively non-toxic to honey bees through acute contact and oral exposures in accordance with
the classification of Atkins (1981). When applied according to the Mettle 125 ME Fungicide
label directions, tetraconazole is not expected to pose a risk to honey bees as the RQs are
significantly less than the LOC (Appendix I, Table 9).

Acute contact exposure of predatory mite (Typhlodromus pyri) and parasitoid (Aphidius
_rhopalosiphi) to tetraconazole, Tetraconazole 40 g/L ME and Tetraconazole 125 g/L ME can_
result in mortality and reduced reproduction. Acute exposure of green lacewing (Chrysoperla
_carnea) and ground beetle (Poecilus cupreus) up to 250 g a.i./ha of tetraconazole 40 g/L ME did_
not result in any significant increase in mortality or observable sublethal effects.

_Typhlodromus pyri, A. rhopalosiphi and C. carnea can be exposed to tetraconazole residues on_
plant foliage while P. cupreus can be exposed to tetraconazole residues in soil. The EECs are
based on the highest cumulative applications that results in the highest foliar and soil residues.
Tetraconazole is not expected to pose a risk to green lacewing (C. carnea), ground beetle
(P. cupreus) and parasitic wasp (A. rhopalosiphi) as the LOC is not exceeded. However,
tetraconazole may pose a risk to the predatory mite (T. pyri) as the LOC is exceeded at the
screening level risk assessment (Appendix I, Table 9). To further characterize the risk to T. pyri,
different exposure scenarios were considered: on-field and off-field (one metre downwind from
the last spray swath). The on-field tier one refinement included a 70% foliar interception factor
in EEC calculations. The off-field refinement assumed a 6% spray drift 1 metre downward from
a ground boom sprayer application and a further 10% interception factor for leaves in off-field
vegetation. After refinement of the exposure scenarios, the LOC is exceeded for the on-field


-----

scenario but not for the off-field scenario. Therefore, tetraconazole may pose a risk to T. pyri in
treated fields (Appendix I, Table 10).

**Non-target plants**
The effects of tetraconazole on non-target plants was determined from the exposure of the
representative formulated product Eminent 125 SL Fungicide (11.6% tetraconazole) to standard
crop species. No treatment related effects were observed up to the highest treatment rate of
112 g a.i./ha. A definitive screening level RQ cannot be determined for terrestrial plants as the
highest cumulative application rate is higher than the highest treatment rate used in the terrestrial
plant toxicity studies. Therefore, the RQs for the terrestrial plants may potentially exceed the
level of concern (Appendix I, Table 9). A refined Tier I assessment was conducted based on drift
of tetraconazole to non-target plants located one metre downwind from the point of application.
The refined RQs did not exceed the LOC for terrestrial plants (Appendix I, Table 11). Therefore,
tetraconazole is not expected to pose a risk to non-target terrestrial vegetation beyond one metre
off-field.

**Birds and small wild mammals**
Tetraconazole is moderately to highly toxic to birds and slightly toxic to rats. Acute exposure of
birds and mammals to tetraconazole can cause mortality and various degrees of sublethal effects,
such as reduced weight and food consumption, lethargy, loss of coordination etc. Chronic
exposure to tetraconazole results in adverse reproductive effects in birds and mammals (for
example, reduced second generation survival and reproductive success in both birds and
mammals and longer gestational times in mammals) and other physiological effects on endocrine
organs and hormones in mammals. There are no data available on endocrine effects in birds.
Tetraconazole is not currently listed as a chemical for screening in the Endocrine Disruptor
Screening Program by the USEPA, however, risks related to its potential for endocrine effects
may be subjected to further characterization if more data become available.

For the bird and mammalian risk assessments, the ingestion of food items contaminated by
tetraconazole spray residues is considered to be the main source of exposure. Hence, the risk
assessment is based on estimated daily exposure which takes into account the concentration of
tetraconazole on various food items immediately after application and the food ingestion rate of
different sizes of birds and mammals. The screening risk assessment was performed based the
most conservative exposure estimates. Based on reasonable worst-case exposure scenarios,
tetraconazole is not expected to pose an acute risk to birds or mammals as the RQs for acute
exposure do not exceed the LOC. Tetraconazole may pose a reproductive risk to both birds and
mammals, except for the smallest size class of mammals, as the RQs for reproduction effects
exceed the LOC (Appendix I, Table 12).

To further characterize the reproductive risk to birds and mammals, the assessment was
expanded to include a range of tetraconazole residue concentrations on all relevant food items.
(Appendix I, Table 13). Also, both on- and off-field exposure estimates were considered. The
off-field exposure takes into account the projected drift deposition at one metre downwind from
the site of application.


-----

When considering maximum tetraconazole residues, the on-field reproductive RQs exceed the
LOC for small and medium sized birds of all feeding guilds, large sized herbivorous birds, large
sized insectivorous birds feeding on small insects, medium sized herbivorous mammals and large
sized herbivorous mammals feeding on leafy foliage, if these animals feed primarily on
tetraconazole treated fields. Therefore, these animals are potentially at risk if they feed
exclusively on tetraconazole treated fields. The off-field reproductive RQs exceed the LOC for
small sized insectivorous and frugivorous birds, medium sized insectivorous birds feeding on
small insects, and large sized herbivorous birds, while the RQs do not exceed the LOC for either
medium sized mammals or large sized mammals (Appendix I, Table 13). Therefore, mammals
feeding exclusively off treated fields are not expected to be at risk.

When considering the mean tetraconazole residues, the on-field RQs exceed the LOC for small
sized insectivorous and frugivorous birds, medium sized insectivorous birds feeding on small
insects, medium sized frugivorous birds, large sized herbivorous birds feeding on short grass and
forage crops. The off-field RQ for small sized insectivorous birds only slightly exceeds the LOC
(RQ = 1.19). Therefore, average tetraconazole residues are not expected to pose a significant risk
to birds feeding exclusively outside treated fields.

**4.2.2 Risks to Aquatic Organisms**

A summary of the freshwater and marine/estuarine toxicity data for tetraconazole, M14360-acid,
M14360-alcohol, M14360-triazolyl acetic acid and Tetraconazole 125 g/L ME is presented in
Appendix I, Table 14. A risk assessment for tetraconazole, these three transformation products
and Mettle 125 ME Fungicide was based on the submitted toxicological data for Daphnia magna
(acute and chronic), freshwater midge (chronic), freshwater fish (acute and chronic early life
stage), freshwater algae, freshwater vascular plant, amphibians (using fish as surrogate data),
marine invertebrates and marine fish. The potential exposure of tetraconazole to the aquatic
environment was based on the screening level EECs from the direct application of tetraconazole
to water bodies of two different depths (15 cm and 80 cm) at the maximum application rates for
strawberries. The 80-cm deep water body was chosen to represent a permanent body of water
and the 15-cm deep water body was chosen to represent a seasonal body of water typical of
amphibian habitat. The result of the screening level risk assessment for aquatic organisms is
presented in Appendix I, Table 15.

**Freshwater invertebrates**
Acute exposure of Daphnia magna to tetraconazole can result in mortality while chronic
exposure can result in reduced growth and reproduction. Mettle 125 ME Fungicide and the
transformation products of tetraconazole, M14360-acid, M14360-alcohol and M14360-triazolyl
acetic acid, are less toxic to D. magna than tetraconazole. Chronic exposure of sediment
dwelling midges (Chironomus riparius) to tetraconazole can affect their survival and emergence.
The screening level risk quotients for exposure of D. magna and C. riparius, however, do not
exceed the LOC.


-----

**Freshwater fish and amphibians**
Acute exposure of freshwater fish to tetraconazole can result in mortality and some sublethal
effects such as loss of equilibrium, moribundity, increased pigmentation and lethargy. Mettle 125
ME Fungicide and transformation products of tetraconazole, M14360-acid, M14360-alcohol and
M14360-triazolyl acetic acid, are less toxic to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) than
tetraconazole. None of these chemicals are expected to pose an acute risk to rainbow trout as the
RQs of these chemical to rainbow trout do not exceed the LOC. Tetraconazole exerts a similar
magnitude of toxicity to bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) as to rainbow trout and is also
not expected to pose any acute risk to bluegill sunfish, either. Chronic exposure of tetraconazole
to fathead minnow during early life-stages can result in lower hatching success, mortality and
reduced growth (weight and length); however, tetraconazole is not expected to pose a chronic
risk to fish as the RQ for fathead minnow does not exceed the LOC.

Risk to amphibians was assessed using fish toxicity data as surrogate endpoints. Acute risk was
based on the EC50 from the bluegill sunfish from the acute toxicity study while chronic risk was
based on the NOEL from the fathead minnow from the early life stage study. The amphibian
screening level RQs did not exceed the LOC; hence, tetraconazole is not expected to pose a risk
to amphibians.

**Freshwater Algae and Aquatic Vascular Plants**
Exposure of algae and aquatic vascular plants to tetraconazole may result in growth inhibition.
Mettle 125 ME Fungicide and transformation products of tetraconazole, M14360-acid,
M14360-alcohol and M14360-triazolyl acetic acid, are less toxic to green algae (Scenedesmus
_subspicatus) than tetraconazole. Tetraconazole exerted a similar magnitude of toxicity to the_
freshwater vascular plants (Lemna gibba) as to freshwater algae. None of these chemicals are
expected to pose a risk to freshwater algae or aquatic vascular plants as the RQs did not exceed
the LOC.

**Marine and Estuarine Species**
Tetraconazole was acutely toxic to mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia), eastern oyster
(Crassostrea virginica) and sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegates). Exposure to
tetraconazole can result in mortality, abnormal swimming behaviour and lethargy in A. bahia,
reduced shell grown in C. virginica, and mortality, lethargy and loss of equilibrium in
_C.variegates. The screening level RQs for these species, however, do not exceed the LOC._
Therefore, tetraconazole is not expected to pose an acute risk to most marine estuarine species.

Effects and risk of tetraconazole to marine algae are not assessed as no studies have been
submitted. Based on the effects and risks of tetraconazole to freshwater algae and other marine
organisms, tetraconazole is not likely to pose significantly more risk to marine algae than to
other aquatic species.


-----

**4.2.3 Incident Reports (Environment)**

Since April 26, 2007, registrants have been required by law to report incidents, including adverse
effects to health and the environment, to the PMRA. Information on the reporting of incidents
can be found on the Pesticides and Pest Management portion of the Health Canada’s website.
Environmental incident reports are obtained from two main sources, the Canadian pesticide
incident reporting system (including both mandatory reporting from the registrant and voluntary
reporting from the public and other government departments) and the USEPA Ecological
Incident Information System. As of May 29th 2012, no environmental incident reports were
found for tetraconazole in either databases.

##### 5.0 Value

**5.1** **Effectiveness Against Pests**

**5.1.1 Acceptable Efficacy Claims**

**5.1.1.1 Control of powdery mildew on grape**

Results from eleven trials conducted in the United States in 2006–2009 were reviewed. Powdery
mildew infection on leaves was recorded in seven trials under moderate to high disease pressure
(average disease severity at 42% in non-treated control). Mettle 125 ME Fungicide reduced
disease severity by 80%, 90% and 83% at the rates of 219, 292 and 365 mL/ha, respectively.
Powdery mildew infection on grape bunches was recorded in nine trials under moderate to high
disease pressure (average severity at 47% in non-treated control). Mettle 125 ME Fungicide
reduced disease severity by 86%, 93% and 90% at the rates of 219, 292 and 365 mL/ha,
respectively. The efficacy of Mettle 125 ME Fungicide was comparable to the commercial
standard in the same trials. The efficacy data supported a 14-day spray interval for control of
powdery mildew on grapes. A 21-day spray interval under low to moderate disease pressure is
also supported since an acceptable level of control was achieved even under high disease
pressure in some trials. The claim for control of powdery mildew on grape is supported at the
rates of 219-365 mL/ha.

**5.1.1.2 Control of black rot on grape**

Results from three trials conducted in the United States in 2006-2009 were reviewed. In one trial
under moderate disease pressure, Mettle 125 ME Fungicide reduced black rot severity on fruit
bunches and leaves by 38 and 69% at the rate of 365 mL/ha, respectively. Mettle 125 ME
Fungicide only provided partial suppression and suppression of black rot on grape bunches and
leaves. The low efficacy in this trial could be a result of the delayed second application since the
disease was not effectively controlled in the early stages of crop development. In the other two
trials under high disease pressure, Mettle 125 ME Fungicide reduced black rot severity on fruit
bunches by 94-100%, and reduced disease incidence on leaves by 79-95% at the rate of
365 mL/ha. The efficacy of Mettle 125 ME Fungicide was comparable to the commercial
standard applied in the same trials. The claim for control of black rot on grape is supported at the
rates of 292-365 mL/ha.


-----

**5.1.1.3 Control of powdery mildew on gooseberry**

There were no efficacy data submitted. However, the data from strawberry trials can be
extrapolated to support this claim. Gooseberry powdery mildew is a common problem, affecting
all varieties. Fungicide spray is needed at the pre-bloom stage prior to disease development to
protect the plants from mildew infection. The causal pathogen, Sphaerotheca macularis, is the
same as on strawberry. Since the claim for control of powdery mildew on strawberry is
supported at the rates of 219-365 mL/ha and the same application rate has been shown to be
effective for the control of powdery mildew on grape, the claim for control of powdery mildew
on gooseberry is supported at the rates of 219-365 mL/ha.

**5.1.1.4 Control of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet**

Results from nine trials conducted in the United States in 2001–2009 were reviewed. In six trials
with cercospora leaf spot at moderate to high pressure, Mettle 125 ME Fungicide reduced
disease severity by 60% which was comparable to the disease reduction achieved by the
commercial standard. Mettle 125 ME Fungicide also reduced disease infection (either number of
spot per leaf or percent infection) by 86% and 98% in two trials under low disease pressure, and
reduced disease infection (number of spot per leaf) by 89% in one trial under moderate disease
pressure. Yield benefits from Mettle 125 ME Fungicide treatments were also demonstrated in six
out of nine trials. The claim for control of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet is supported at the
rates of 950 mL/ha.

**5.1.1.5 Control of powdery mildew on sugar beet**

Results from seven trials conducted in the United States, Austria and Germany in 2000–2005
were reviewed. In five trials with powdery mildew at moderate pressure, Mettle 125 ME
Fungicide reduced disease severity by 90% in one trial at the rate of 800 mL/ha, and by 96% in
another trial at the rate of 950 mL/ha. The rate of 800 mL/ha was tested in two Austrian trials
under high disease pressure. Mettle 125 ME Fungicide reduced disease severity by 68% and 72%
at the rate of 800 mL/ha in these trials. There was no commercial standard tested in these trials.
Yield benefits from Mettle 125 ME Fungicide treatments were also demonstrated in some trials.
The claim for control of powdery mildew on sugar beet is supported at the rates of 950 mL/ha.


-----

**5.1.1.6 Control of powdery mildew on strawberry**

Results from two trials conducted in the United States in 2006 and 2008 were reviewed. In one
trial under low disease pressure, Mettle 125 ME Fungicide reduced foliar disease severity by 89,
92 and 89% at the rates of 250, 334 and 417 mL/ha, respectively. The efficacy of Mettle 125 ME
Fungicide was superior to the commercial standard. However, Mettle 125 ME Fungicide only
partially suppressed foliar disease severity by 44-50% in another trial.

Results from five additional trials conducted in China, Poland, and Turkey from 1999 to 2009
were also reviewed. Powdery mildew was recorded as moderate to high disease pressure
(severity at 45-86%) in these trials. Tetraconazole reduced disease severity by 72-94% (average
88% across all rates applied) at the rate range of 26.7-50 g a.i./ha (equivalent to Mettle 125 ME
Fungicide at 219-417 mL/ha) in the Chinese and Turkish trials. Two applications were applied in
these trials. A single tetraconazole rate of 61 g a.i./ha (equivalent to Mettle 125 ME Fungicide at
509 mL/ha) was tested in the Poland trial. The treatment reduced powdery mildew severity by
88% under a moderate disease pressure. The claim for control of powdery mildew on strawberry
is supported at the rates of 219-365 mL/ha.

**5.2** **Phytotoxicity to Host Plants**

No phytotoxicity or crop injury was reported.

**5.3** **Economics**

No market analysis was done for this application.

**5.4** **Sustainability**

**5.4.1 Survey of Alternatives**

Refer to Appendix I, Table 17 for a summary of the active ingredients currently registered for the
same uses as Mettle 125 ME Fungicide.

**5.4.2 Compatibility with Current Management Practices Including Integrated Pest**
**Management**

The use of Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is compatible with current integrated pest management
practices and production practices.

**5.4.3 Information on the Occurrence or Possible Occurrence of the Development of**
**Resistance**

According to the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee, tetraconazole is a Group 3 fungicide
(DMI). The group is estimated to be at medium risk of disease resistance development and
resistance management must be considered. For instance, powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) on
grape is currently listed as a pathogen with medium risk to develop fungicide resistance, and
fungicide failure has also been reported on the control of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet due
to widespread resistance of Cercospora beticola to fungicides. Alternation or mixtures with an
effective non cross-resistant fungicide are especially crucial. Resistance management
recommendations are addressed on the product label.

**5.4.4 Contribution to Risk Reduction and Sustainability**

Mettle 125 ME Fungicide offers additional tools to Canadian growers for disease and resistance
management on labelled crops. Mettle 125 ME Fungicide should be integrated into an overall
disease management program.

##### 6.0 Pest Control Product Policy Considerations

**6.1** **Toxic Substances Management Policy Considerations**

The Toxic Substances Management Policy (TSMP) is a federal government policy developed to
provide direction on the management of substances of concern that are released into the
environment. The TSMP calls for the virtual elimination of Track 1 substances [those that meet
all four criteria outlined in the policy, i.e. persistent (in air, soil, water and/or sediment),
bio-accumulative, primarily a result of human activity and toxic as defined by the Canadian
_Environmental Protection Act]._

During the review process, tetraconazole and its transformation products were assessed in
accordance with the PMRA Regulatory Directive DIR99-03[5] and evaluated against the Track 1
criteria. The PMRA has reached the following conclusions:

Tetraconazole does not meet all Track 1 criteria, and is not considered a Track 1 substance. See
Appendix I, Table 16 for comparison with Track 1 criteria.

Tetraconazole does not form any major transformation products that meet all Track 1 criteria.
See Appendix I, Table 16 for comparison with Track 1 criteria.

_Management Policy_


-----

**6.2** **Formulants and Contaminants of Health or Environmental Concern**

During the review process, contaminants in the technical and formulants and contaminants in the
end-use products are compared against the List of Pest control Product Formulants and
_Contaminants of Health or Environmental Concern maintained in the Canada Gazette.[6]The list_
is used as described in the PMRA Notice of Intent NOI2005-01[7] and is based on existing policies
and regulations including: DIR99-03; and DIR2006-02,[8] and taking into consideration the
Ozone-depleting Substance Regulations, 1998, of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act
(substances designated under the Montreal Protocol). The PMRA has reached the following
conclusions:

Based on the formulating process used, impurities and formulants of human health or
environmental concern as identified in the Canada Gazette, Part II, Vol. 142, No. 13, SI/2008-67
(2008-06-25), including TSMP Track 1 substances and allergens known to cause anaphylactictype reactions, are not expected to be present in the product Mettle 125 ME Fungicide or carried
through from the technical grade active ingredient.

##### 7.0 Summary

**7.1** **Human Health and Safety**

The toxicology database submitted for tetraconazole is adequate to define the majority of toxic
effects that may result from exposure. There was no evidence of increased susceptibility of the
young in reproduction or developmental toxicity studies. Tetraconazole is not selectively
neurotoxic or immunotoxic. In short-term and chronic studies on laboratory animals, the primary
targets were the liver, bones, kidney and several endocrine organs (adrenals, ovary, thyroid and
pituitary). After longer-term dosing there was no evidence of oncogencity in the rat. There was
evidence of liver oncogenicity in the mouse after longer-term dosing, but this effect was
dependent on a threshold-based mode of action. The risk assessment protects against the toxic
effects noted above by ensuring that the level of human exposure is well below the lowest dose
at which these effects occurred in animal tests.

The nature of the residue in plants and animals is adequately understood. The residue definition
in plant products and animal matrices is tetraconazole. The proposed use of tetraconazole on
grapes, gooseberries, strawberries, and sugar beets does not constitute an unacceptable chronic or
acute dietary risk (food and drinking water) to any segment of the population, including infants,
children, adults and seniors. Sufficient crop residue data have been reviewed to recommend
maximum residue limits to protect human health. The PMRA recommends that the following
maximum residue limits be specified for residues of tetraconazole.

**Recommended MRL**
**Commodity**

**(ppm)**

Crop Subgroup 13-07F – Small fruit vine climbing subgroup, except
0.2
fuzzy kiwifruit

Crop Subgroup 13-07G – Low growing berry subgroup 0.25

Sugar beet roots 0.05

Sugar beet molasses 0.15

Fat, kidney, meat, and meat byproducts (except liver) of cattle, goats,
0.02
horses, hogs and sheep

Liver of cattle, goats, horses, hogs and sheep 0.05

Milk 0.01

Mixers, loaders, applicators and workers entering treated fields are not expected to be exposed to
levels of tetraconazole that will result in unacceptable risk when Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is
used according to label directions. The personal protective equipment on the product label is
adequate to protect workers. Risk to workers re-entering treated areas is not of concern provided
that specified restricted entry intervals are observed.

Bystander exposure to individuals in pick-your-own scenarios is not expected to result in
unacceptable risk when Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is used according to label directions.

**7.2** **Environmental Risk**

Tetraconazole is persistent in soils and aquatic systems. It has low mobility in soils, but may
eventually reach ground water with long-term repeated use. It has low volatility and atmospheric
concentrations are expected to be negligible. Tetraconazole has low bioconcentration potential.
Tetraconazole may pose a risk to non-target arthropods, birds, mammals and terrestrial plants.
Therefore, statements on the product label are required to inform users of the potential risks. In
order to minimize the potential exposure resulting from off-field drift, non-spray buffer zones
will be required between the treated area and downwind terrestrial habitats.

**7.3** **Value**

Since the diseases claimed are of serious concern to the production of the crops in question, there
is a strong grower demand for this product in Canada, especially considering that the product is
currently registered in the United States. Making the product available for Canadian growers
offers a new fungicide option for use, and improves the level of efficacy of pest control on these
crops. Some other triazoles fungicides (i.e. prothioconazole, metconazole and myclobutanil) are
already registered in Canada, but this product will add an additional product in the same
chemical group which will contribute to disease management options for these targeted diseases.
An additional value consideration is that the supported uses address two priorities identified in
the Canadian Grower Priority Database, those being powdery mildew on sugar beet and
strawberry.

A summary of the proposed and accepted uses for Mettle 125 ME Fungicide is presented in
Appendix I, Table 18.

##### 8.0 Proposed Regulatory Decision

Health Canada’s PMRA, under the authority of the Pest Control Products Act and Regulations,
is proposing full registration for the sale and use of Tetraconazole Technical Fungicide and
Mettle 125 ME Fungicide, containing the technical grade active ingredient tetraconazole, to
control powdery mildew on grape, gooseberry, strawberry and sugar beet; black rot on grape;
and cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet.

An evaluation of available scientific information found that, under the approved conditions of
use, the product has value and does not present an unacceptable risk to human health or the
environment.

Metabolism/Toxicokinetic, oral **Rate and extent of absorption: Absorption of tetraconazole was rapid and dose**
(gavage, single dose and 14-day dependent. Maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) occurred from ~1 to 27 hrs post-dose
repeat dosing) (Tmax), depending on the dose level, sex and radiolabel; single-dose Tmax values were ~1 to

8 hrs at the low dose and ~4 to 27 hrs at the high dose; the later times were for ♀ and for

Sprague-Dawley rats the [14]C-triazole radiolabel. Regardless of the dose, ♂ Cmax values were slightly higher and

area-under-the-curve (AUC) values were slightly lower compared to ♀. The AUC values

PMRA # 1904048, 1904056, were also higher for the [14]C-triazole compared to the [14]C-phenyl label. The extent of uptake
1904060, 1904063 to 1904065, was moderate to high, as evidenced by the total recoveries in the urine. Overall, absorption
1904067, 1904070, 1904077, characteristics were similar with single and repeated doses.
1904080 to 1904087, 1904111,
1904112, 2194362, 2194363 **Distribution / target organ(s): Distribution was extensive, but with no evidence of**

bioaccumulation. Although the [14]C-phenyl label accumulated rapidly in the fat, there was

14C-phenyl and 14C-triazole no evidence that it was specifically retained in this or any other tissue after single or
radiolabels repeated doses. The highest tissue-specific residue concentrations occurred in the GIT,

liver, kidney, adrenal glands and ovaries, regardless of the dose level, radiolabel used and
whether dosing was single or repeated. Apart from the ovary, which had higher
radioactivity than the testes, there were only minimal differences in the distribution
between the sexes. Lower tissue levels after repeated dosing was considered evidence of
metabolic adaptation.

**Metabolism: With the [14]C-triazole label, 1,2,4-triazole was the major metabolite in the**
urine (♂ 65-70% AD; ♀ 48-63% AD) after 48 hrs; concurrent levels in the feces were
lower (♂ 6-10% AD; ♀ 8-10% AD). The major transformation pathways included
oxidation, reduction and conjugation mediated by glutathione. With the [14]C-phenyl label,
the major metabolites were P1 (sulfoxide conjugate; ♂ 9-19% AD; ♀ 35-45% AD) in the
urine and P4 (N-acetylcysteine conjugate) in urine (♂ 19% AD; ♀ 2% AD) and feces (♂
12% AD; ♀ 3% AD). Minor metabolites included tetraconazole-acid (6 to 18% AD in
urine, with lower values in ♂), tetraconazole-alcohol (< 8% AD in feces) and M3, M6, P2
(< 9% AD in urine), P3 (< 7% AD in urine) and P5 (< 8% AD in feces). In addition, minor
amounts of tetraconazole-dichlorophenyl-3OH (S5, < 4% AD) and tetraconazoledichlorophenyl-5OH (S6, < 2% AD) occurred in the feces (free) and urine (conjugated),
while tetraconazole-difluoroacetic acid was detected in the urine (<2% AD). Only a minor
amount of the recovered radiolabel was unidentified.

**Rate and extent of excretion: Excretion was rapid; it was nearly complete after 48 hrs.**
There were no substantive differences in the excretion half-lives (t1/2) between sexes or
dose levels, but the values for the [14]C-triazole label were slightly less those of the [14]Cphenyl label. The major route of excretion was via the urine. Both sexes excreted greater
amounts in the urine (52-76% AD) than in the feces (12-36% AD) within 72 hrs. Compared
to the [14]C-phenyl label, the extent of excretion of the [14]C-triazole label was higher in the
urine and lower in the feces. Biliary excretion was not assessed, but was inferred from the
levels of unchanged parent in the feces (< 6% AD), which were much lower than the total
radiolabel recoveries in the feces. Excretion was largely independent of the sex, dose level
and radiolabel. Acclimation via increased urinary excretion was evident with repeated
dosing.

|Col1|NATURE OF THE RESIDUE IN LAYING HEN|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|PMRA # 1904991|Col8|Col9|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Two groups of six laying hens were fed a daily oral dose of tetraconazole (M14360) for 3 consecutive days. The compound was radiolabelled in either the triazole ring or the phenyl ring. The target dose was 10 ppm in the diet per day (~1.3-1.4 mg tetraconazole/kg bw/day). The hens were sacrificed within 22 hrs of the last dose. At the time of sacrifice, 23.3 % of the AD (14.39 ppm), and 29.7% AD (20.89 ppm) had been excreted in hens dosed with [14C-triazole]- and [14C-phenyl]-tetraconazole, respectively. The proportion of TRRs detected in eggs was low (<0.7 % AD for yolks [both labels]; 1.4 % and 1.5% AD for whites in the phenyl study and triazole study, respectively), indicating minimal transfer of tetraconazole residues to eggs. TRRs in yolks and whites increased over time from Day 1 to Day 3. The highest tissue concentrations of residues were detected in fat (11.612 and 11.293 ppm for [14C-triazole]- and [14C-phenyl]- treated animals, respectively). There were also detectable residues in liver (3.518 and 3.560 ppm for [14C-triazole]- and [14C-phenyl]-treated animals, respectively). Residues in muscle were the lowest of the tissues that were tested (0.599 and 0.532 ppm for [14C-triazole]- and [14C-phenyl]-treated animals, respectively). Metabolic Pathway It appears that tetraconazole is initially oxidized to tetraconazole-DFA. Further metabolism may lead to the formation of tetraconazole-acid, and ring separation, resulting in free triazole.|||||||||

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|In two separate studies, one lactating goat was fed a daily oral dose of tetraconazole for five consecutive days in each study. The compound was radiolabelled in either the triazole ring, or the phenyl ring. The target dose rate was 20 mg/day for the goat treated with triazole-labelled substance, and 19.2 mg/day for the goat treated with phenyl-labelled tetraconazole (equivalent to ~0.45 ppm/day in the diet). The goats were terminated by intravenous injection within 24 hrs of the final dose. The majority of the AD was excreted (64.38 % and 77.5% AD in triazole- and phenyl-label study, respectively). In milk, TRRs were low (0.4-3.86% AD). Peak residue concentrations (0.59-0.118 ppm) in milk were reached on the 5th day of dosing. The highest tissue concentrations of residues were detected in the liver (3.21-3.440 ppm; 3.31-3.5% AD). Metabolic Pathway Tetraconazole appears to be metabolized to triazole. This may occur through initial oxidation to tetraconazole-DFA, followed by hydrolysis to form tetraconazole-alcohol. Glutathione conjugation of tetraconazole-alcohol and/or –acid and subsequent triazole cleavage may also occur.|||||||

|Three groups of lactating cows were dosed orally twice daily with tetrazonazole for 28-30 consecutive days. Based on a daily feed intake of 20 kg/day, the dosing rate was 0.35 ppm, 1.05 ppm, and 3.5 ppm in the diet. Milk was collected from each animal twice daily, and tissues (liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, peritoneal fat) were collected within 24 hrs of sacrifice. With the exception of 2 animals, all cows were terminated within 24 hrs of the final dose. One cow was sacrificed 7 days after the last dose, and a second cow was terminated 14 days after the final dose to study the depuration phase. Tetraconazole was present in all whole milk samples at the highest dosing level (3.5 ppm), was present in 2 whole milk samples at the 1.05 ppm dosing level, and was not quantifiable at the lowest dosing level (0.35 ppm) in animals sacrificed within 24 hrs of the last dose. Residues of tetraconazole were all non-quantifiable in samples collected from animals sacrificed 7 days and 14 days following the final dose. At the 3.5 ppm dosing level, mean residues of tetraconazole in whole milk were <LOQ on the first day after dosing began, and reached a maximum of 0.025 ppm 18 days after the first dose was administered. Residues of tetraconazole were not quantifiable in any of the skimmed milk samples. Mean residues of tetraconazole were quantifiable in all cream samples at all dosing levels (0.020-0.021, 0.053-0.092, and 0.266-0.300 ppm at the 0.35, 1.05, and 3.5 ppm dosing level, respectively). In tissues, the highest mean residues of tetraconazole observed in the liver at all dosing levels (0.268, 0.376, and 1.345 ppm at the 0.35, 1.05, and 3.5 ppm dosing level, respectively). Mean residues of tetraconazole were lower in samples from animals that were sacrificed 7 days and 14 days following the final dose than they were in samples from animals sacrificed within 24 hrs of the final dose. Tetraconazole mean residues were higher in peritoneal fat (<0.017, 0.051, and 0.119 ppm at the 0.35, 1.05, and 3.5 ppm dosing level, respectively) than they were in kidney (<0.01, 0.024, and 0.055 ppm at the 0.35, 1.05, and 3.5 ppm dosing level, respectively), subcutaneous fat (<0.015, 0.029, and 0.077 ppm at the 0.35, 1.05, and 3.5 ppm dosing level, respectively), and muscle (<0.01, <0.01, and <0.09 ppm at the 0.35, 1.05, and 3.5 ppm dosing level, respectively). The lowest tetraconazole residues in tissues were observed in muscle.||||||||||||||

There are treated animal feedstuffs resulting from the use of tetraconazole on sugar beets (molasses and dried pulp).

The More Balanced Diet (MBD) was used to calculate the dietary burden and anticipated residues in animal matrices. The dietary
burden was determined to be 0.06 ppm in both dairy cattle and beef cattle. The dietary burden in poultry and swine is 0 ppm.

a At the screening level, EECs are based on a direct application at maximum cumulative application rate and thus considers the maximum
label application rate, the number of applications, the application interval and the dissipation between applications.
For tetraconazole in soil: 4 × 45.6 g a.i./ha at 14 day interval. Dissipation in soil: estimated single first-order DT50 of 1868 days (estimated
by multiplying the longest soil DT50.
For tetraconazole on foliage:1x119 g a.i./ha with default dissipation on foliagehalf-life of 10 days.
For M14360-alcohol, M14360-triazolyl acetic acid and M14360-acid was determined by assuming 100% conversion of tetraconazole and
were corrected for the molecular weight ratio of the transformation products to tetraconazole.
b Toxicity in µg/bee converted to the equivalent kg a.i./ha using a conversion factor of 1.12 (Atkins et al., 1981)

a EDE = Estimated dietary exposure; is calculated using the following formula: (FIR/BW) × EEC, where:
FIR: Food Ingestion Rate (Nagy, 1987).
b On-field residues are based on a direct application at maximum cumulative application and thus considers the maximum label application
rate the number of applications, the application interval and the dissipation between applications.
c The off-field assessment was based on the highest projected drift deposition relevant to the tetraconazole use pattern (74% drift for early
season airblast applications).
For mammals, the “all mammals” equation was used: FIR (g dry weight/day) = 0.235(BW in g) [0.822]
BW: Generic Body Weight
EEC: Concentration of pesticide on food item based on Hoerger and Kenaga (1972) and Kenaga (1973) and modified according to Fletcher

a At the screening level, EECs are based on a direct application at maximum cumulative application rate and thus considers the maximum
label application rate, the number of applications, the application interval and the dissipation between applications.
For tetraconazole: 4 × 45.6 g a.i./ha at 14-day interval. Dissipation in water: half-life of 372 days (longest laboratory whole system halflives).
For M14360-alcohol, M14360-triazolyl acetic acid and M14360-acid was determined by assuming 100% conversion of tetraconazole and
were corrected for the molecular weight ratio of the transformation products to tetraconazole.

1 All pesticides will be considered toxic or toxic equivalent for the purpose of initially assessing a pesticide against the TSMP criteria.
Assessment of the toxicity criterion may be refined if required (i.e. all other TSMP criteria are met).
2 The policy considers a substance “predominantly anthropogenic” if, based on expert judgement, its concentration in the environment
medium is largely due to human activity, rather than to natural sources or releases.
3 If the pesticide and/or the transformation product(s) meet one persistence criterion identified for one media (soil, water, sediment or air)
than the criterion for persistence is considered to be met.
4 Field data (for example, BAFs) are preferred over laboratory data (for example, BCFs) which, in turn, are preferred over chemical
properties (for example, log Kow).

- Codex is an international organization under the auspices of the United Nations that develops international food standards, including
MRLs.

Maximum residue limits may vary from one country to another for a number of reasons,
including differences in pesticide use patterns and the locations of the field crop trials used to
generate residue chemistry data. For animal commodities, differences in MRLs can be due to
different livestock feed items and practices.

Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canada, the United States and
Mexico are committed to resolving MRL discrepancies to the broadest extent possible.
Harmonization will standardize the protection of human health across North America and
promote the free trade of safe food products. Until harmonization is achieved, the Canadian
